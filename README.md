Project Overview
The project involves the following key steps:

Data Import and Cleaning: The dataset was imported into SQLite for initial data exploration and cleaning. This involved handling missing values, ensuring data types were consistent, and preparing the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various SQL queries were executed to explore the dataset. This included summarizing data, calculating averages, and identifying trends.

Visualization: The cleaned data was imported into Tableau for visualization. The dashboard created includes:

Three bar charts showing medical charges by:
Sex
Region
Smoking status
Two scatter plots demonstrating the correlation between:
Age and medical charges
BMI and medical charges
Insights
The analysis revealed several important insights:

Medical Charges by Demographics: Significant differences in medical charges were observed based on sex, region, and smoking status. For instance, smokers generally incurred higher medical costs compared to non-smokers.
Age and BMI Correlation: The scatter plots highlighted the relationship between a patientâ€™s age and BMI with their medical charges, though the correlations were relatively weak, indicating other factors may play a more substantial role in determining costs.
Tools and Technologies
SQLite: Used for data import, cleaning, and executing SQL queries for initial analysis.
Tableau: Employed for creating visualizations and building an interactive dashboard to present the findings.
Repository Contents
Data: The raw and cleaned dataset.
SQL Scripts: Scripts used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
Tableau Workbook: The workbook containing all visualizations and the dashboard.
Documentation: Detailed documentation on the steps taken, insights gained, and visualizations created.
Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to perform comprehensive data analysis and visualization, providing actionable insights into healthcare costs. It demonstrates proficiency in using SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for creating impactful visualizations, making it a strong addition to my portfolio as I pursue opportunities in the healthcare industry as a data analyst.
